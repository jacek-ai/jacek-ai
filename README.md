# AI Engineer building enterprise-grade agent-based AI systems on Microsoft Azure

I design and implement reliable reasoning systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM orchestration, and secure enterprise architecture patterns — especially in regulated environments such as insurance and finance.

## Featured Project

### Azure Insurance Assistant — Agent-based RAG system

Production-oriented architecture supporting insurance consultants working with complex, versioned policy documentation.

Key architectural concepts:

- Product-gated RAG pipelines
- Strict policy-context isolation for regulatory-safe reasoning
- Agent-based tool orchestration (Azure AI Foundry)
- Controlled retrieval workflows
- Enterprise security patterns (Managed Identity, RBAC)
- Infrastructure-as-Code deployment (Bicep)

Goal: reduce hallucination risk and improve traceability of AI-generated responses.

## Architecture Focus

- Designing agent-based reasoning systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures
- LLM orchestration with LangChain / LangGraph
- Secure enterprise AI systems on Microsoft Azure
- Bridging AI architecture decisions with real business workflows

## Exploration & Prototyping

- LangChain and LangGraph orchestration experiments
- Retrieval workflow design
- Early prototyping with Python and Streamlit
