# Hi, I'm Jacek 👋

AI Engineer designing enterprise-grade agent-based Generative AI systems on Microsoft Azure.

I focus on building reliable reasoning systems using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM orchestration, and secure enterprise architecture patterns — especially in regulated environments such as insurance and finance.



## 🚀 Featured Work

### Azure Insurance Assistant

Production-oriented RAG architecture designed for insurance consultants working with complex, versioned policy documentation.

Key architectural concepts:

- Product-gated RAG pipelines
- Strict policy-context isolation for regulatory-safe reasoning
- Agent-based tool orchestration (Azure AI Foundry)
- Controlled retrieval workflows
- Enterprise security (Managed Identity, RBAC)
- Infrastructure-as-Code deployment (Bicep)

Goal: reduce hallucination risk and improve traceability of AI-generated responses.



## 🧠 Engineering Focus

- Generative AI & LLM integration (Azure OpenAI)
- RAG and agentic architectures
- Intelligent document processing
- Enterprise AI systems for regulated environments
- Bridging AI architecture decisions with real business workflows



## 🧪 Exploration & Prototyping

- LangChain / LangGraph orchestration experiments
- Retrieval workflow design
- Early prototyping using Python and Streamlit



## 👨‍💻 Background

Microsoft Certified: Azure AI Engineer Associate.

With 20+ years in software engineering, architecture, and delivery across insurance, banking, and public sector systems, I combine deep technical experience with business-oriented AI system design.
